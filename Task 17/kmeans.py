#K-Means clustering implementation

#Some hints on how to start have been added to this file.
#You will have to add more code that just the hints provided here for the full implementation.


# ====
# Define a function that computes the distance between two data points


# ====
# Define a function that reads data in from the csv files  HINT: http://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html


# ====
# Write the initialisation procedure


# ====
# Implement the k-means algorithm, using appropriate looping



# ====
# Print out the results
